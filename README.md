# Highway Name Remover

This mod removes display names from highways. Note: Currently only works for English language.

You can still change the name of a highway to a custom one, just the default values are invisible. If you want to remove a custom name, just remove all the text and hit Enter, it will then default back to the original (invisible) name.

## Dependencies

None

## Installation

1. Download the ZIP file.
2. Find your `Cities: Skylines II` game folder (default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cities_Skylines II`) and navigate to `Cities2_Data\StreamingAssets\Data~`
3. Replace `en-US.loc` with the one from the ZIP file.

## Further Notes

This only works for highways. If wanted I can work on a version for streets as well. Feel free to create an issue in the GitHub repository to get in contact.
